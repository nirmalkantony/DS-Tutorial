The Iris Dataset is a well-known dataset that is included in the sklearn.datasets module. It contains measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each flower is described by four features:

    1.Sepal Length (in cm)

    2.Sepal Width (in cm)

    3.Petal Length (in cm)

    4.Petal Width (in cm)

The target variable is the species of the iris flower, which is encoded as:

    0 for setosa

    1 for versicolor

    2 for virginica
